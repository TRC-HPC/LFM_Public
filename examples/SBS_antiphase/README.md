## README file ##

Simulation of a 2D square cylinders in side by side configuration,  at Re = 150, Mach = 0.2
Anti phase flow pattern configuration
Structured mesh, 4.4 million cells

## Before running ##

Untar the following files:
    0/U.tgz
    0/alpha.tgz
    constant/polymesh/faces.tgz.tgz
    constant/polymesh/neighbour.tgz
    constant/polymesh/owner.tgz
    constant/polymesh/points.tgz
    
## Run solver (LFM or caaFOAM) from ($DIR)/SBS_antiphase folder ##

## If boundary conditions are changed, it is necessary to rerun the Eikonal solver ##
