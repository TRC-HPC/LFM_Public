## README file ##

Simulation of a 2D Cylinder at Re = 150, Mach = 0.2
Structured mesh, 525000 cells

## Before running ##

Untar the following files:
    0/U.tgz
    0/alpha.tgz
    constant/polymesh/faces.tgz
    constant/polymesh/neighbour.tgz
    constant/polymesh/owner.tgz
    constant/polymesh/points.tgz
    
## Run solver (LFM or caaFOAM) from ($DIR)/cylinder_vortex folder ##

## If boundary conditions are changed, it is necessary to rerun the Eikonal solver ##
